Wordpress theme for a digital CV

The theme is supported by Bootstrap, FontAwesome, jQuery and the plugin "jQuery.inview".

How to use:

This theme is built by widgets. If you want to add content to your site,
go to Appearance --> Widgets on the wp-admin site.

If you for example want to add an education to the site, 
then you simply drag the "Education" widget on the left side of the screen, 
to the "Educations" block on the right side of the screen and fill in your content.
The same rule applies to the other widgets. Drag your widget to the correct block.

You can have multiple widgets in one block.

!!N.B. You will only need one widget each in the "Colors", "Images" and "Footer" blocks.!!
In the colors widget, you will set the selected font colors and background colors to all the blocks.
The images widget contains three images, "Top image", "Middle image" and "Bottom image".
Select your images easily with the image picker.

Enjoy!
